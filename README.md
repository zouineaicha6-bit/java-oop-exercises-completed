# OOP Lab – Revision Exercises
*Object-Oriented Programming & Modeling (Lectures 1–4)*

# Overview

This lab consists of a collection of **code-completion programming exercises** designed to reinforce the Object-Oriented Programming concepts covered in Lectures 1–4. Each exercise provides a partially implemented Java class or code fragment with clearly marked **TODO sections** that you must complete.

Throughout this lab, you will practice and apply:

- Classes, objects, methods, and constructors  
- Instance versus static members  
- Encapsulation, visibility modifiers, and the `this` keyword  
- Object relationships: association, aggregation, and composition  
- Abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism  
- Exception handling (`try`, `catch`, `throw`, `throws`, `finally`)  
- Creating and using custom exceptions  

Your objective is to complete all TODO sections, ensure your code compiles and runs, and demonstrate solid understanding of OOP principles and Java best practices.
